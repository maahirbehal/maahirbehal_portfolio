        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>My journey into analytics started in operations, where I saw the impact of data on day-to-day decisions. That experience shaped how I approach analysis today: focus on the business question, build the right KPIs, and turn results into action.</p>
        <p>Through academic and self-directed projects, I have delivered end-to-end analyses across sales and performance data. I enjoy blending structured analysis with narrative storytelling so stakeholders can move from insight to execution quickly.</p>

        <h3>Hungry Jack's Experience</h3>
        <p>Working in a fast-paced operations environment taught me how frontline decisions rely on clear, timely information. That context now guides how I design dashboards and prioritize metrics that matter most to teams on the ground.</p>
